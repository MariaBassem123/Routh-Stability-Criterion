# Rauth-Stability-Criterion

This is a python project that given the characteristic equation of the system, for example on this form:
s^5+s^4+10s^3+72s^2+152s+240
Our code can:
1.  Use Routh criteria, state if the system is stable or not.
2. If the system is not stable, we list the number and values of poles in the RHS of the s-plane.
